In a language of your choice, please write a program which accepts as input a sorted array of numbers, with duplicates, and a number, and returns the tightest possible range within that array which bounds the number.

For example:

`yourFunction([1,1,2,2,2,3,7,8,8,12], 6)` should return `[3,7]`

`yourFunction([1,2,3], 2)` should return `[2,2]`
